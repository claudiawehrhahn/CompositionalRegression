This Readme file describes the steps to run the Dependent multivariate Bernstein polynomial process (DMBPP) for compositional regresion. This model is proposed and described in the paper "Dependent Bayesian nonparametric modeling of compositional data using random Bernstein polynomials" by Claudia Wehrhahn, Andr√©s F. Barrientos and Alejandro Jara.
 
General description
- Points 1. and 2. below describe how to run the DMBPP model using the C code used in the simulation study in the paper. In this simulation the number of beta paramters is pCov = 2 and the dimension of the symplex is d = 2.
- Point 3. describes how to run the DMBPP model using the nimble R package. Its usage is illustrated in one of the simulated data sets, but is simple to adapt for other data sets.


Detailed description
1. Do R CMD SHLIB depSymplexCodeMCMC.c from console while in the directory where the depSymplexCodeMCMC.c file is. The files depSymplexCodeMCMC.o and depSymplexCodeMCMC.so should be created.

2. In an R session, run wrapperDepSymplexMCMC.R for one of the simulated data sets.

3. In an R session, run the NIMBLEDepSymplex.R file for one of the simulated data sets.
